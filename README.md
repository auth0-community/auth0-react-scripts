Use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap a new React project with authentication.

This repo is not a fork of `create-react-app`. It's just a fork of `react-scripts` with modifications to the project template.

This repo is supported and maintained by Community Developers, not Auth0. For more information about different support levels check https://auth0.com/docs/support/matrix .

## Getting started

### Installation

```
create-react-app my-app --scripts-version auth0-react-scripts
```

- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with your Auth0 configurations. You can find your Auth0 clientId and domain at your dashboard: https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients

- Add `http://localhost:3000/login` to your [Auth0 callback URLs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients).

## Usage

Here you can find a link to example: [sample app](https://auth0-react-app.now.sh)

### Auth Helpers

**login(lockOptions)**

Show [Auth0 lock](https://auth0.com/lock). Accepts any options that [`lock.show()`](https://github.com/auth0/lock#showoptions) accepts.

**logout()**

Clears authentication token from the browser and redirects to `/login`.

**requireAuth**

An [onEnter handler](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#onenternextstate-replace-callback) for `react-router`. Add this handler to any `Route` that requires an authenticated user. The handler will ensure the user is authenticated before displaying the route. If the user is not authenticated, the handler will redirect them to `/login` and return them back to their previous route once they authenticate.

```js
<Route path="/profile/edit" component={EditProfile} onEnter={requireAuth} />
```

**connectProfile(Component)**

Connects a react component to an authenticated user's profile. It does not modify the component class passed to it. Instead, it returns a new, connected component class, for you to use. Your wrapped component will receive two additional props:

* **profile**
	An [Auth0 Profile](https://auth0.com/docs/user-profile) object for an authenticated user.

* **onUpdateProfile(attributes)**
	Call to update profile. Returns a `Promise` that may resolve into an error if the update fails.

	*Tip: The profile props can be quickly added to your component's `propTypes` with `connectProfile.PropTypes`*

```js
static propTypes = {
  ...connectProfile.PropTypes
}
```

**fetchAsUser(input, init)**

A wrapper around [`window.fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch), that will automatically set the `Authorization` header when a user is authenticated.

* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts) with the same user
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and create user identity flow securely
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in
* Pull data from other sources and add it to user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules)
